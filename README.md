Tic Tac Toe (Terminal Version – Python)


This project is a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game developed in Python.
It allows two players to play against each other by typing board positions using letters (A–C) and numbers (1–3).
The project focuses on basic Python concepts, such as lists, functions, user input handling, and game state representation.

How the Game Works


The board is represented using a 2D list, simulating a Tic Tac Toe grid.
Rows are identified by letters: A, B, C
Columns are identified by numbers: 1, 2, 3
Players choose their moves by typing a position like A1, B2, C3, etc.
The game prints the board after every move.


Limitations / Future Improvements


No win condition checking yet
No draw detection
No input validation for invalid or repeated positions
These features can be added as future improvements.
